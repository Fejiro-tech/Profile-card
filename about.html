      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Priscillia Osumaka, I'm a Frontend developer who loves turning ideas into clean, intuitive web interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always wanted to build a meaningful career — one that challenges me, inspires me, and allows me to create real impact. Although I originally studied Political Science, I found myself drawn to technology and creativity. I wanted to do something different, something that let me combine logic with design. 
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        That curiosity led me to explore frontend development, and I instantly fell in love with the process of bringing ideas to life through code. Today, I'm proud to be a frontend developer who's constantly learning, building, and improving.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For me, tech isn't just a career switch — it's a passion that reflects who I am: a problem-solver, a creator, and a woman determined to make her mark in the digital world.

      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
  
      <p>
